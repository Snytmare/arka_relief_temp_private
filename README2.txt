# Call To Action - Global Relief Mesh

These times are hard, and it’s painful to see. 

All across the world we are seeing climate disasters, the proliferation of war and irredentism, the rise of authoritarianism and a collapse in structure.

My heart is heavy with all of this, and as I write this I have tears in my eyes.

I am building something I hope will help, a global relief mesh that I am hoping beyond hope will ease some of this suffering.

I need a team of front end and back end engineers who can help to implement the structure of this relief effort.

Every entity, whether it be a person, an organization, or just someone looking to offer a hand in any way they can is represented as a node.

People can post needs in the form of a json and submit it to the website.

Anyone offering help can do the same.

Everything is logged and I intend to make everything auditable.

This is a decentralized effort, the git will be made public and anyone who wants to fork it or modify it can as long as you use it ethically and with one purpose in mind: to ease the suffering of everyone.

I’m not a skilled coder but I’ve utilized ChatGPT to get the front end and back end running, and anyone who is willing to contribute help will have my gratitude and the gratitude of everyone they help.

I need stress testers, I need f and b end engineers, I need anyone willing to contribute anything they can to an effort that means more right now than it may for another century.

Thank you for considering, I truly believe if we put our heads together we can solve problems facing humanity in a way that reliably sets humanity up for the future we all want, one line at a time, one piece of art at a time.
