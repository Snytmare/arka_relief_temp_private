### TRUST.md (Guiding Principles)
- Trust is earned through **fulfilled commitments**.
- Nodes may **vouch** for others using a signed `vouch.json`.
- Nodes with repeated failures or disputes may be flagged, but never automatically banned.
- Trust is **recursive**, **peer-based**, and **transparent**.
